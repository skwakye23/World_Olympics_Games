Background
The modern Olympic Games is a leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, alternating between the summer and Winter Games every two years in the four-year period. From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, the Games have grown to about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the 2012 Summer Olympics
It is a known fact that Europe is the continent with the most Olympic medals (i.e. Gold, Silver and Bronze). Europe is also by far the continent with the most participants/athletes for the games. Figure (a) in the appendix below shows a significant disproportion in the number of Olympic athletes by the various continents since 1980.
